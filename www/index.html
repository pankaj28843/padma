<h2>Padma: A Telugu Text Transformer</h2>

<p><strong>Padma</strong> is a technology for transfroming Telugu text between various public and proprietary formats. A Firefox extension (by the name Padma) illustrates the use of the technology for Mozilla based applications. Output formats supported are <a href="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode</a> and <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/soc.culture.indian.telugu/browse_thread/thread/48eac8e35ba0bef4/69ec85d46731ce73">RTS</a>. Currently supported input methods are <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/soc.culture.indian.telugu/browse_thread/thread/48eac8e35ba0bef4/69ec85d46731ce73">RTS</a> (Rice Transliteration Scheme), <a href="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode</a>, the font scheme used by <a href="http://www.eenadu.net">Eenadu</a> as well as Shree Tel 900 and Hemalatha fonts. Shree Tel 900 is used by many web sites including <a href="http://www.andhrajyothy.com/">Andhra Jyothy</a> and Hemalatha - a <a href="http://www.cdac.in">CDAC</a> developed font - is used by <a href="http://www.andhraprabha.com/">Andhra Prabha</a> among others. The extension is capable of transforming web pages using the above fonts automatically to Unicode. It can also manually transform selected text to the desired output format.</p>

<p>After <strong>Padma</strong> is installed, automatic transformation can be enabled and disabled from the option dialog accessible through Tools->Extensions->Padma. The user can also add a list of web sites that they want to be automatically transformed from this dialog.</p>

<p>To enable manual transformation, new menu items are displayed whenever the context menu is launched (typically when the right mouse button is pressed). Three menu items transform selected text to Unicode - two of them expect input in RTS and one for all other encoding schemes. Another menu item transforms selected text to RTS. This selection can span arbitrary elements. For RTS input, the two menu items differ only in specifying the start mode for the transformation - English or Telugu. Following the standard RTS conventions, <strong>Padma</strong> uses '#' as a delimiter to switch between languages. For RTS output, three different styles are supported - Kanneganti, Pillalamarri and Palana. See <a href="http://www.bhaavana.net/telusa/1995/0299.html">here</a> for a definition of these 3 styles.</p>

<p>The current stable version of <strong>Padma</strong> is <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/padma/padma-0.2.6.xpi" onclick="return install(this, 'Padma 0.2.6');">0.2.6</a>. The current development release is <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/padma/padma-0.3.4.xpi" onclick="return install(this, 'Padma 0.3.4);">0.3.4</a>. Support for <a href="http://www.eenadu.net">Eenadu</a> was first added in the 0.3.0 release. Support for Shree Tel 900 (and hence <a href="http://www.andhrajyothy.com">Andhra Jyothy</a>) was first added in the 0.3.1 release. Transformation from Unicode and to RTS was first added in the 0.3.2 release. Support for Hemalatha (and hence <a href="http://www.andhraprabha.com">Andhra Prabha</a>) was first added in the 0.3.3 release. Support for automatic transformation was first added in the 0.3.4 release. Click <a href="installation.html">here</a> for Release Notes.</p>

<p><strong>Padma</strong> is inspired by Kolichala Suresh's implementation of a convertor from RTS to Unicode for the Internet Explorer. Many thanks to Kolichala Suresh, Indraganti Padma and Ben Bennett for their inputs and advice.</p>
